## Goal

We are developing an effective learning model that can predict proper entry and exist signals for short and long term trades in the highly volatile crypto market.

## Trading Strategy

Our trading strategy combines multiple technical indicators into a single strategy. A stragey that makes investment decisions based on   future price movements derived primarily from historicl prices. We leverage signals poduced by indicators to determine entry and exit points. These indicators fall into three categories which include:

                    1) Momentum Indicators -  

                    such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), allow you to determine the direction and strength of a current price trend. As an asset begins to build momentum, opening a new position will become less risky. Looking at Moving Average indicators also help you gauge momentum.

                    2)Trend Indicators -

                    Allow you to determine whether an asset is currently overbought or oversold. Many trend following indicators, such as Bollinger Bands, attempt to create a clear “channel". A clear channel will tell you whether prices are close to breaking out or returning to normal.

                    3)Volume Indicators -

                    Help traders identify the (strong) relationship between price and volume. Increases in trading volume almost always result in an increase in price. However, these events do not always occur at the same time, which is why volume indicators are good for advanced forecasting. The On Balance Volume (OBV) and Money Flow are two of the most useful volume indicators.

If you’re a scalper and trading on the 5-minute chart, having many indicators on it would make things more difficult because of the frequency of the signals you receive. A trader utilizing the daily chart has more time to think about the different signals and analyses the chart in detail.

What is your style or strategy, goal, or risk management measures?
If you are new to trading we will create one for you.

Simply put, a trading plan helps by identifying expected outcomes, setting realistic goals, understanding a risk profile, which in turn determines a trading strategy and style. This helps to eliminate emotional pitfalls that might be present when one is trading.

However, formulating a trading plan is just the initial step. What comes next is evaluation. It is important to note that a trader must constantly analyse each and every individual trade undertaken and its following results closely. Was the plan followed, and if not, why? The frequency of evaluation differs from trader to trader. Intraday traders should do a daily review of their trades, while for long-term traders, it might be sufficient to do a weekly review.

Having a trading plan also allows an individual to track whether there have been improvements made. After each analysis of the trader’s performance, they can discover where things went right or wrong. No one can be a perfect trader as losses are part of the game. However, by constantly analysing performance, errors and weaknesses can either be eliminated or reduced, whereas, winning streaks can be further built upon.
